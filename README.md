You need to develop a color converter from HEX to RGB.

When the correct color is entered, it shows its RGB representation and changes the background color to the given one:
![Color](./assets/color.png)

When entering an incorrect color in HEX format, the converter should report an error:
![Error](./assets/error.png)

You must wait for all seven characters to be entered, including the pound sign, to decide whether to show an error or change the background color.
